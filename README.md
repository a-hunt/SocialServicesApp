# SocialServicesApp
For the creation of an application that homeless and low income families can utized in find services they need.
There are many government and private agencies that support people in need; however, their minimum budget does not leave much room to inform the people who would utilize their services. Generally, people struggling with homelessness or lower income are ill informed of the assistance available to them, as well as, what may be needed to take advantage of those services. To solve this issue, I propose the creation a phone app that can act as a one stop shop for listing this information. The app can then be used directly by people in need or other service providers assisting people in need. This is possible because the majority of people, even people suffering from homelessness, either have a smart phone or know someone who does.
Looking for help to create this application in HTML5, so that it may be accessed via an application as well as a website.
